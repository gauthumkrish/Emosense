I must say the product is great in space and design. Even in semi loaded and moderate settings it's cooling nicely in this summer condition. Now I have not monitored the energy consumption of it and would surely like to do it in future. I am satisfied with the product .",

It converted water to ice within an hour. (Note - There was nothing else inside except a water bottle.) I don't know the exact time, but when I checked after 55 mins, ice was formed.So far it's working perfectly fine without any noticeable sound.",

For the design, I would say that I'm a bit disappointed with the third tray, as its too narrow...  Overall, a very good refrigerator. Packing was absolutely top class. The courier partners unfortunately, delayed the delivery, which led to a minor hiccup. Eyes closed, u can trust brand Samsung in refrigerators.",

But I have made a mistake by not including 3years protection while buying this TV. Wall mounted by Jeeves perfectly and charged only 400 rs. Overall a nice experience. Thanks.",

The interesting part is the speakers, It is the best dolby atmos speaker I have ever seen.Overall the TV is beast.I do not have any hate on this TV. For pictures quality I'll give 4stars. It gives the best color on the TV screen. I have purchased 3years extended warranty, because in this warranty the agents will repair the TV on the door step itself,",

  "Review": "The TV doesn't even Support Widevine DRM security Level: L1 which all streaming apps require for playing 4k content. So it's 4k quality is just for show since we can't even use it. Disney+hotstar doesn't let me play 4k content because TV support DRM L3 which unprotected instead of L1. So no 4k content. 1080P tv is better than this mess. All you can do with this 4k TV is play YouTube in 4k. No other paying streaming app. Very disappointed.",

Tv display is bit flimsy while holding the tv for mounting, but it may be because it is large at 55 Inch.5.

It doesn't have a power on/off button. There is a battery level indicater button on side. When you press it once, it will show the battery level remaining. If you press it twice, it will go on low- current discharge mode when you can charge devices like Bluetooth headphones and smartbands. When you connect...",

Display is good and bright but i noticed Mi 11 lite feels much better and brighter some times. Battery life is too good. But camera is bit disappointed not as good as expected in this price range. Low light experience was very poor . Video quality is just ok. If you are a camera lover then this phone is not ok for you. I hope...",

Front camera is good.. performance is also good.. i got easily 8-9 hours screen on time.. and it's charge 2-100% in 17 minutes in my test.

Picture Quality is Nice. but in low light and night we doesn't capture a nice shot.2. The phone Procceser works really nice in normal Use. I say in normal use because I never use this phone for playing High Graphics games. I never face any heating issue for a while.3. This  phone has high power battery. It easily get overs a full day with quite heavy use.",

Benefits : Very low consumption, Cleaning quality is good, No smell of detergent after wash & Very good quality of dryness (Have to dry 10-30 min after put it out from the washing machine). No headache to cleaning clothes. This is why the fully automatic washing machine recommended. Moreover, I'm satisfied with its performance.",

I selected a samsung because its cost was more than LG machine and thought that this one will be more better than LG, BUT when i used it i found that I made a very big mistake. LG machine is even very very much better than it. This makes high noise and i can not wash soft clothes. I had to wash them manually.",

  "Review": "This is a great product within its price range. I had initially trouble setting its colours since the instructions booklet writes meagerly about how to customise it to your needs. I used the computer gtaphics methods to make it function according to my requirements. I use it as a TV also since I have an internal TV tuner card. Though an LCD monitor its colours and 3D effect are stunning. It is an ace among monitors and a great value for money..I do hope it will  give years of service. Thank y...",

  "Review": "The product from MSI is good. But the service from flipkart is horrible. The sound quality of monitor is average and wanted to return it and buy some other monitor with better sound quality. But flipkart won't allow it. For me it's noting more than a junk. Total waste. If you have extra money and need a junk that seems pretty go and buy products from flipkart.I am keeping this in my store room as a souvenir from Flipkart.*Can't you guys even publish a genuine feedback*",
